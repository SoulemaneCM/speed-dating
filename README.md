How can we secure a second date ?

This set was taken of the kaggle challenge "Speed Dating". 

"Data was gathered from participants in experimental speed dating events from 2002-2004. During the events, the attendees would have a four minute "first date" with every other participant of the opposite sex. At the end of their four minutes, participants were asked if they would like to see their date again. They were also asked to rate their date on six attributes: Attractiveness, Sincerity, Intelligence, Fun, Ambition, and Shared Interests."

The purpose of this project is to use data visualisation in order to understand the dataset and gain information regarding what are the variables allowing someone to secure a second date.
